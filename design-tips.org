* Golden Ratio (1:1.618):
Use this ratio for layout proportions. For example, if your content area is 1000px wide, your sidebar could be 618px.

* Rule of Thirds:
Divide your layout into a 3x3 grid. Place key elements along these lines or at their intersections for balanced composition.

* 60-30-10 Color Rule:
Use your primary color for 60% of the design, secondary color for 30%, and accent color for 10%.

* F-Pattern Layout:
Arrange important content along an F-shaped pattern, as this mimics typical web reading patterns.

* Whitespace (Negative Space):
Aim for a content-to-whitespace ratio of about 40:60. This improves readability and focuses attention on your content.

* Typography Hierarchy:
Use a scale like 1:1.5 for your type sizes. If your body text is 16px, your h1 could be 24px (16 * 1.5).

* Responsive Design:
Design with a mobile-first approach. Use common breakpoints: 480px, 768px, 1024px, and 1200px.

* Page Load Speed:
Aim for a load time under 3 seconds. Optimize images and minimize HTTP requests.

* Contrast Ratio:
For accessibility, maintain a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 between text and background colors.

* Call-to-Action (CTA) Prominence:
Make CTAs 20% larger than your regular content to draw attention. Place them in the top 25% of the page for visibility.
